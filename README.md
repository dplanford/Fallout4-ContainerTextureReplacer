# Fallout4-ContainerTextureReplacer
A simple Fallout 4 mod, with FOMod support, that can change the look of many of the containers in the game (suitcases, duffle bags, toolboxes, etc.)

So this is the first step in a mod that we're making that will eventually replace the vanilla suitcase and a few other containers. Because it just bothers me that every suitcase in the Fallout world looks exactly like every other suitcase in the Fallout world. Right now, this simply replaces the suitcase with one of 23 textures -- so, yeah, they'll all still look exactly the same (ironic, I know), but what can you do? We're learning!  Our big plan is to make it so that the settlers of the commonwealth know what do do with a needle and thread, I mean, come on, they can make armor from bits of cloth and aluminum cans, but they are lugging around, boring, 200 year old suitcases everywhere?  I say nay. 

Anyway, this is the first step, and we present it to y'all. 

It's in FOMOD format, so the choice is yours.  Eventually, when we figure it out, you'll be able to make any of these suitcases for your settlements, but we thought that we would put this out just for the heck of it. Basically, it was a good learning experience for us (we're a husband and wife team) and we're having fun learning how to do it.

Installation: Download the FOMOD and chose one texture.  We're working on how to put more than one in the game, but for now, it's just one. You can download it at any time in your playthrough.

Uninstall: It's a texture replacer, if you uninstall with your mod manager the suitcases will go back to the vanilla texture.

Conflicts: This will obviously conflict with anything that changes the texture of the suitcase, but as far as I know, there isn't another mod that does that. I looked and couldn't find one. 

Credits: The mod was made using Photoshop and the Creation Kit. 
Thank you XunAmarox for the FOMOD tutorial, it was invaluable.
The "Artsy" cloth texture comes from FantasyStock, but the rest of the cloth textures come from Textures.com, the leather and metal parts are vanilla assets. 
And of course Bethesda for the game. 

Permissions:  Don't upload this file anywhere else without my permission.  Thanks.

Update, June 20, 2017:

Since the original upload, we've added some other containers to this mod (coolers, duffle bags, bottlecap tins). Also check out our larger mod, "A Variety of Containers", which adds all of these as craftable items in the settlement workshop, and out in the game world.
